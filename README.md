# Cloud File Home Server
 
Simple Cloud File local server builded in NodeJS using Express.

I have developed a mobile APP built in Javascript using [Svelte](https://svelte.dev/) + [Capacitor](https://capacitorjs.com/) and whit this [template](https://github.com/drannex42/svelte-capacitor) that it is a client for this file server.

Start Server : node index.js

If you want to use the server for regular use i have made an [electron desktop App](https://github.com/PiterWeb/Cloud-File-Home-Server/releases) that runs the server and display the local IP and the port of the computer to made it easier for all.

You can get the APP [here](https://github.com/PiterWeb/Cloud-File-Home-APP)

I hope this project can be usefull for you :D
