# Cloud File Home Server
 
Simple Cloud File local server builded in NodeJS using Express.

I have developed a mobile APP built in Javascript using [Svelte](https://svelte.dev/) + [Capacitor](https://capacitorjs.com/) and whit this [template](https://github.com/drannex42/svelte-capacitor) that it is a client for this file server.

U can get the APP [here]

I hope this project can be usefull for you :D
